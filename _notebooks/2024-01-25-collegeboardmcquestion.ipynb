    "For procedures A, the procedure repeatedly adds 2 to result five times, resulting in the intended product 10. Vice versa for C. IF you want to return the result and get a correct answer, multiplying 2,-5 and -2,-5 will give you the wanted result. The following procedure is intended to return the value of x times y, where x and y are integers. Multiplication is implemented using repeated additions. A and C fit these requirements."
