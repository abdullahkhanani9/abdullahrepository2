## College Board Practice Exam 2 Reflection: Journey, Corrections, and Learnings

### Journey and Learnings

Exploring the Internet's Evolution

In preparation for my study week, I delved into archived team teachings, distilling key insights on the Internet's transformation. I efficiently reviewed concise video explanations tracing the historical journey from ARPANET to the contemporary web. Seeking clarifications from the team enhanced my comprehension of technical aspects.

Navigating Routing and Computing Realms

Transitioning swiftly to discussions on routing and computing, I engaged in dynamic exchanges with peers, leveraging collective knowledge to grasp core concepts. Visualizing data packet transmission through fast-paced online video tutorials proved effective. Quick Q&A sessions with the team focused on key algorithms and computational thinking, ensuring rapid understanding.

Unveiling the Dual Nature of the Internet

To swiftly grasp the Internet's dual nature, I engaged in expedited discussions with creators, aiming for concise insights into both benefits and risks. Navigating through online documentaries and lectures provided diverse perspectives on cybersecurity threats and privacy concerns. Time-efficient discussions with peers enriched my understanding.

Exploring Disparities in the Digital Divide

Streamlining my exploration of the Digital Divide, I referred to concise team teachings and engaged in focused discussions with creators. Extracting insights from peers facilitated targeted discussions on bridging efforts. Analyzing streamlined statistical data and engaging in quick peer conversations amplified my understanding of its impact.

Analyzing Biases in Computing Systems

In the analysis of biases in computing, I prioritized succinct team teachings and engaged with creators for rapid comprehension. Optimizing online resources such as TED talks and panel discussions facilitated a swift absorption of ethical challenges related to biases in digital systems. Time-efficient discussions with peers allowed for diverse viewpoints, quickly enriching my understanding.

Navigating Challenges of Unsolved Problems and Crowdsourcing

Efficiently navigating unsolvable computing problems involved a focused revision of team teachings. Quick consultations with creators helped in grasping theoretical frameworks rapidly. Streamlined discussions with peers and expedited analysis of recorded seminar case studies provided practical insights into the applications of crowdsourcing.

Recapitulating and Ready for Time Management

Approaching the final phase, I adeptly condensed key points from shared team teachings and insights from creators. Leveraging quick discussions with peers and rapid-fire queries further solidified my understanding. Focusing on targeted practice questions maximized my efficiency in handling the time-constrained multiple-choice exam.

### Score
 I got a 43/67 on the test

 ### Corrections
 
 ##### Question 2: 
Explanation: The work may be distributed to amateur or nonprofessional individuals, who are not likely to have the same accuracy as the professional researchers.

 ##### Question 5:
Explanation: Incorrect. With these inputs, the OR gate will produce an output of true and the first AND gate will produce an output of false. Since only one input to the second AND gate will be true, the circuit will have an output of false.

 ##### Question 11:
Explanation: Incorrect. The binary RGB triplet for light yellow is (11111111, 11111111, 11100000).

##### Question 24: 
Explanation: Incorrect. The value of val starts at 0 and is repeatedly incremented by 2, so it counts even integers, not odd integers.

##### Question 26:
Explanation: Incorrect. Metadata is data about data; copyright information is considered descriptive information about the image.

##### Question 32:
Explanation: Incorrect. This code segment divides the sum of the scores by one less than the number of scores and then subtracts the lowest score, rather than averaging all but the lowest score.

##### Question 33:
Explanation: Incorrect. This information can be determined by comparing each student’s original average to the course grade after the lowest score was dropped.

##### Question 34:
Explanation: Incorrect. In this code segment, the first call to BotMover moves the robot forward one square, rotates it right three times so that it faces left, and moves it forward one square. The second call to BotMover moves the robot forward one square, rotates it right 1 times so that it faces toward the top of the grid, then moves it forward one square. The third call to BotMover moves the robot forward one square, does not rotate it, then moves it forward one square to the upper left corner of the grid.

##### Question 35:
Explanation: Incorrect. The Min procedure performs similarly to the MaxTwo procedure (in that it compares two values), but it does not generalize this functionality to calculate the maximum of any number of values.

##### Question 39:
Explanation: Incorrect. Interchanging lines 1 and 2 will have no effect on the output of the program, as the variables can be initialized in either order before entering the loop.

##### Question 41: 
Explanation: Incorrect. Statement I is correct. It will first call TrimRight to remove the four rightmost characters (the file extension). It will then pass the result to TrimLeft, which will remove the eleven leftmost characters (the date tag), leaving only the desired description. Statement II is incorrect. It will first call TrimRight to remove the eleven rightmost characters, which includes more than just the file extension. It will then pass the result to TrimLeft to remove the four leftmost characters, which does not remove the entire date tag.

##### Question 46:
Explanation: Incorrect. All Internet-connected devices are assigned an IP address. Certificate authorities are used to validate encryption keys.

##### Question 49:
Explanation: Incorrect. Using 8 bits will allow for up to 256 employees. However, a unique bit sequence can be assigned to each employee using only 7 bits.

##### Question 51:
Explanation: Incorrect. Creative Commons licenses do not affect the reliability of transmitted information.

##### Question 52:
Explanation: Incorrect. Statement I is true. The REPEAT UNTIL loop terminates when hours is at least 24 or currentPop is at most 0. Statement II is false. The simulation displays the change in population over the entire course of the simulation.

##### Question 54:
Explanation: Incorrect. This change will add only odd elements from originalList to newList instead of adding even elements.

##### Question 55:
Explanation: Incorrect. By starting the process by writing a height at the top of the card and writing a 2 at the bottom of the card, the algorithm will work such that the last person’s card will have the sum of the heights at the top and two times the number of people at the bottom. Dividing the top by the bottom will give half the average height instead of the average height.

##### Question 56:
Explanation: Incorrect. Version I calls GetPrediction once for each element of idList, while version II calls GetPrediction twice for each element of idList (plus one more time at the end). Therefore, version II takes more than 1 minute longer than version I.

##### Question 58:
Explanation: Incorrect. For this set of inputs, the IF condition x = y evaluates to false, so the body of the ELSE statement is executed. The expression y = z evaluates to true, so true is returned as intended.

##### Question 60:
Explanation: Incorrect. For example, assume that list1 contains [10, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60] and list2 contains [20, 20, 40, 60, 80]. The first line of code creates newList1, which contains [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]. The second line of code creates newList2, which contains [20, 40, 60, 80]. The third line of code creates bothList, which contains [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 20, 40, 60, 80]. The fourth line of code assigns to count the length of list1 (7) plus the length of list2 (5) minus the length of bothList (10), producing the incorrect result 2.

##### Question 63:
Explanation: A and C, answered A and B

##### Question 64:
Explanation: Incorrect. For these values, the procedure repeatedly adds 2 to result five times, resulting in the intended product 10.

##### Question 65:
Explanation: Incorrect. This code segment stores the substring "lope" in animal. It then concatenates "lope" and "a", storing the result "lopea" in animal. Lastly, it concatenates the substring "jack" and "lopea", storing the result "jacklopea" in animal.

##### Question 66:
Explanation: C and D, answered A and C,
