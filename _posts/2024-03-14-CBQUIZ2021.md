## My Score
I scored a 77% or 54/70, which is barely a 1.0

## Journey
Increased understanding: The entire team imparted a wealth of information to help me grasp the concepts tested in the quiz.
Enhanced preparation: Engaging in additional practice problems and tests afforded me a clearer understanding of what to expect on the exam.

### Question 8
Which of the following best describes a direct benefit in using redundant routing on the Internet?

A
Redundancy enables messages to be transmitted with as few packets as possible.
B
Redundancy enables network devices to communicate with as few network connections as possible.
C
Redundancy often allows messages to be sent on the network even if some network devices or connections have failed.
D
Redundancy prevents network communications from being intercepted by unauthorized individuals.

#### What I Chose and Why it's Wrong

I chose B, the correct answer was C because Redundancy within a system usually requires additional resources, not fewer. A path within a redundant system may be longer than the shortest possible path.

### Question 15

Procedure Call
drawLine(x1, y1, x2, y2)	
Explanation
Draws a line segment on a coordinate grid with endpoints at coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)

The drawLine procedure is to be used to draw the following figure on a coordinate grid.


A
xVal  1
yVal  0
len  1
REPEAT 5 TIMES
{
drawLine(xVal, yVal, xVal, yVal + len)
xVal  xVal + 1
len  len + 1
}
B
xVal  1
yVal  0
len  1
REPEAT 5 TIMES
{
drawLine(xVal, yVal, xVal + len, yVal)
yVal  yVal + 1
len  len + 1
}
C
xVal  5
yVal  0
len  5
REPEAT 5 TIMES
{
drawLine(xVal, yVal, xVal, yVal + len)
xVal  xVal - 1
}
D
xVal  5
yVal  0
len  5
REPEAT 5 TIMES
{
drawLine(xVal, yVal, xVal + len, yVal)
yVal  yVal - 1
len  len - 1
}

#### What I Chose and Why it's Wrong

I Chose D, correct answer was A. D was wrong because This code segment draws five horizontal line segments, starting with the segment from (5, 0) to (10, 0) and ending with the segment from (5, -4) to (6, -4).

## Question 37

In the following code segment, assume that the variable n has been initialized with an integer value.

IF n > 10
    ------------------------
    IF n > 100
        DISPLAY "artichoke"
    ELSE
        DISPLAY "broccoli"
    ------------------------
    ELSE
    ------------------------
        IF n > 100
            DISPLAY "carrot"
        ELSE
            DISPLAY "daikon"
    ------------------------

Which of the following is NOT a possible value displayed by the program?
Responses
A: "artichoke"
B: "broccoli"
C: "carrot"
D: "daikon"

#### What I Answered and Why it's wrong

Answered C, correct D
The string "daikon" is displayed for values of n that are less than or equal to 10.

## Question 39

A store uses binary numbers to assign a unique binary sequence to each item in its inventory. What is the minimum number of bits required for each binary sequence if the store has between 75 and 100 items in its inventory?
Responses
A: 5
B: 6
C: 7
D: 8

#### What I Answered and Why it's Wrong

Answered D, correct C
Using 8 bits will allow for up to 256 sequences because . However, a unique bit sequence can be assigned using only 7 bits because 2 raised to 7 = 128.

## Question 42
Consider the following code segment.

-----------------------------------
integerList <-- 4, 2, 5, 4, 2, 3, 1,
result <-- 0
FOR EACH item IN integerList
    result <-- (result + item MOD 2)
DISPLAY result

What value is displayed as a result of executing the code segment?

A: 3
B: 4
C: 9
D: 12

#### What I Answered and Why it's Wrong

Answered C Correct A
This result would be displayed if the code segment computed the sum of the odd values in the list rather than counting the number of odd values in the list.
